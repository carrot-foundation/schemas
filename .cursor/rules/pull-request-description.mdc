# Pull Request Description Standards

This rule enforces proper pull request description formatting using the project's [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md). For the end-to-end PR creation workflow (analysis, branching, CLI usage), see `pull-request.mdc`.

## Template Compliance Requirements

### Core Required Sections

Every PR description MUST include these sections (unless explicitly marked as removable):

1. **🧾 Summary** - Concise 1-2 sentence description focusing on user/business value
2. **🧩 Context** - Business problem explanation with structured prompts:
   - Why this change?
   - Problem it solves
   - Business value
3. **🧱 Scope of this PR** - What's included/excluded with checkboxes
4. **🧪 How to test** - Specific testing instructions and commands
5. **🧠 Considerations for Review** - Focus areas and key files
6. **✅ Pre-merge Checklist** - Complete quality gates

### Optional Sections (Remove if Not Applicable)

- **🔗 Related Links** - Only if relevant links exist
- **🚨 Breaking Changes & Migration** - Only if breaking changes exist
- **📦 Deployment Notes** - Only if non-standard deployment required

Include these only when you have meaningful content. Do not add sections with "None", "N/A", or empty placeholders—remove the section entirely.

## PR Title Standards

### Title Format Requirements

PR titles should be **clear, descriptive, and user-focused** rather than following Conventional Commit format:

- **Start with capital letter** - First word capitalized, rest in sentence case
- **Be concise** - Aim for 50-60 characters maximum
- **Focus on the outcome** - What the PR accomplishes, not how it's implemented
- **Use plain English** - Avoid technical jargon when simpler words convey the same meaning
- **Match PR content** - Title should align with the summary and scope sections

### Title Examples

❌ **Avoid**: Conventional commit format in titles

```
feat(schema): add mass-id IPFS schema
fix(shared): correct UUID validation pattern
chore: update schema generation dependencies
```

✅ **Good**: Clear, descriptive titles

```
Add MassID IPFS and JSON schema definitions
Fix UUID validation pattern in shared definitions
Update schema generation dependencies to latest versions
```

### Title Guidelines by Change Type

**New Features:**

- "Add [feature] for [benefit]"
- "Implement [functionality] to enable [capability]"
- "Introduce [component] for improved [aspect]"

**Bug Fixes:**

- "Fix [issue] in [component]"
- "Resolve [problem] when [condition]"
- "Correct [behavior] for [scenario]"

**Improvements:**

- "Improve [aspect] by [method]"
- "Optimize [component] for better [outcome]"
- "Enhance [feature] with [addition]"

**Configuration/Maintenance:**

- "Update [component] configuration"
- "Upgrade [dependency] to version [X]"
- "Refactor [module] for better maintainability"

### Title Content Alignment

The PR title should reflect:

- **Summary section** - The main accomplishment described
- **Scope section** - The type of change being made
- **Business value** - The user or system benefit achieved

Example alignment:

- **Title**: "Add MassID IPFS schema for waste tracking metadata"
- **Summary**: "Implements MassID IPFS schema with data structure and attributes..."
- **Scope**: "New features" checked
- **Business value**: "Enables standardized waste tracking metadata for Carrot ecosystem"

## Content Quality Standards

### Summary Section

❌ **Avoid**: Generic placeholders, vague descriptions

```markdown
### 🧾 Summary

Updated some files
```

✅ **Good**: Specific, value-focused descriptions

```markdown
### 🧾 Summary

Implements MassID IPFS schema with data structure, attributes, and JSON Schema generation, enabling standardized waste tracking metadata for the Carrot ecosystem.
```

### Context Section

❌ **Avoid**: Empty structured prompts

```markdown
**Why this change?**
**Problem it solves:**
**Business value:**
```

✅ **Good**: Completed structured information

```markdown
**Why this change?** Implement missing MassID schema for waste tracking metadata
**Problem it solves:** No standardized schema exists for MassID IPFS metadata
**Business value:** Enables consistent waste tracking metadata across Carrot ecosystem applications
```

### Scope Section

❌ **Avoid**: Unchecked boxes without selection

```markdown
**This PR includes:**

- [ ] New features
- [ ] Bug fixes
- [ ] Refactoring
```

✅ **Good**: Properly checked relevant items

```markdown
**This PR includes:**

- [x] New features
- [ ] Bug fixes
- [ ] Refactoring
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Configuration changes

**Intentionally excluded**: Gas optimization improvements (scheduled for next PR)
```

### Testing Instructions

❌ **Avoid**: Generic placeholder text

```markdown
_Provide specific testing instructions..._
```

✅ **Good**: Actual commands and steps

```markdown
1. Build schemas: `pnpm build`
2. Generate JSON schemas: `pnpm generate-ipfs-schemas`
3. Validate schemas: `pnpm validate-schemas`
4. Verify MassID schema: Check `schemas/ipfs/mass-id/mass-id.schema.json` exists and validates
```

### Review Considerations

❌ **Avoid**: Uncustomized template content

```markdown
**Key files to review:**

- `path/to/file.ts` - _description of changes_
```

✅ **Good**: Actual files with meaningful descriptions

```markdown
**Key files to review:**

- `src/mass-id/mass-id.schema.ts` - IPFS MassID schema composition and metadata
- `src/shared/definitions.schema.ts` - Shared field definitions (UUIDs, timestamps, hashes)
- `schemas/ipfs/mass-id/mass-id.schema.json` - Generated JSON Schema for MassID (for consumers/validators)
```

## Empty or Non-Applicable Sections

❌ **Avoid**: Declaring a section with "None" or empty content

```markdown
### 🚨 Breaking Changes & Migration

None
```

✅ **Good**: Omit the section entirely when not applicable. Do not include the header if there is nothing meaningful to say.

## Checklist Enforcement

### Required Checklist Completion

All checklist items must be either:

- **Checked** `- [x]` if completed/applicable
- **Explained** if not applicable (add comment explaining why)

Note: “N/A + reason” is acceptable for checklist items but NOT as the sole content of a section.

❌ **Avoid**: Unchecked items without explanation

```markdown
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines and naming conventions
- [ ] All new code has appropriate test coverage
```

✅ **Good**: Properly addressed items

```markdown
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines and naming conventions
- [x] All new code has appropriate test coverage
- [x] Linter warnings and errors have been resolved
- [x] No debugging code or console logs remain
- [x] TypeScript strict mode compliance verified
- [ ] End-to-end tests updated — N/A (documentation-only PR)
```

## Format Consistency Standards

### Markdown Structure

- Use consistent header levels (`###` for main sections)
- Maintain emoji prefixes for section headers
- Include horizontal rule before checklist: `---`
- Use proper checkbox syntax: `- [ ]` and `- [x]`

### Linking Standards

- Use descriptive link text: `[Schema Architecture](mdc:CLAUDE.md)`
- Reference specific issues/tickets: `Closes #123` or `Related to #456`
- Include Notion page links: `[Project Spec](https://notion.so/...)`

### Content Organization

- Remove irrelevant sections rather than leaving empty
- Keep sections concise but informative
- Use bullet points for lists and structured data
- Include code snippets for complex testing steps

### Prohibited content and footers

- Do not include any footer messages, signatures, boilerplate closings, or meta commentary in PR descriptions. Keep the description limited to the template sections only.
- Examples of prohibited footers: "This standard ensures consistent, high-quality PR descriptions...", "Submitted by <team>", or auto-generated disclaimers.
- When writing content of any section, avoid words like: "to keep consistency and integrity", "to ensure quality", or "to maintain standards". Focus on the specific changes and their impact.

## Quality Gates

### Before Submitting PR

1. **PR title quality** - Clear, descriptive title following title standards
1. **Template completeness** - All relevant sections filled
1. **Content meaningfulness** - No placeholder text remains
1. **Checklist verification** - All items addressed or explained
1. **Link validation** - All references are accessible
1. **Grammar/spelling** - Professional communication standards

### Common Issues to Avoid

- Using conventional commit format in PR titles
- Leaving empty structured prompts
- Generic or vague summaries
- Unchecked checklists without explanation
- Missing testing instructions
- Broken or missing links to related work
- Adding footer messages/signatures/meta commentary at the end of the PR description
