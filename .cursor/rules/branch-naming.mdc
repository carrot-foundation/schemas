# Branch Naming Rules

Follow these conventions for all branches. Names should be concise, descriptive, and machine-friendly.

## Format

- Preferred: `<type>/<short-description>`
- Alternate with scope: `<type>/<scope>-<short-description>`
- Ticket suffix variants: `<type>/<short-description>-<TICKET>` or `<type>/<scope>-<short-description>-<TICKET>`
- Ticket prefix variants: `<TICKET>/<type>/<short-description>` or `<TICKET>/<type>/<scope>-<short-description>`

Where:

- `type` is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `style`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`
- `scope` (optional) typically mirrors commit scopes for this repo (`schema`, `shared`) – see [Commit Message Rules](./commit.mdc) – but may be slightly broader for clarity when helpful (e.g., `schema-mass-id`, `shared-helpers`)
- `short-description` is lowercase kebab-case with 3–6 words describing the change
- `TICKET` is an optional tracker ID like `CARROT-123`

## Rules

- Use lowercase and kebab-case for words
- Use only letters, digits, hyphens, and slashes
- Keep branches ≤ 60 characters when possible
- Avoid generic words like `update`, `changes`, `stuff`
- Do not include punctuation other than `-` and `/`
- One slash after `type` is preferred; additional slashes only for ticket prefix

## Special Branches

- Long-lived: `main`
- Release branches: `release/<version>` (semver, e.g., `release/1.2.3`)
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<short-description>` (use when patching production)
- Automated updates: `renovate/*` (allowed bot branches)

## Examples

- `feat/schema-add-mass-id-schema`
- `feat/shared-improve-hash-helpers`
- `fix/schema-correct-gas-id-attributes`
- `chore/shared-bump-dev-dependencies`
- `CARROT-123/feat/schema-add-purchase-id-schema`
- `CARROT-456/fix/shared-harden-uuid-validation`
- `release/1.4.0`
- `hotfix/schema-fix-mass-id-validation`

## Guidance

- Match your branch `type` and `scope` to your commit messages for consistency
- If unsure about `scope`, choose the most specific area touched by most changes
- Prefer short, clear descriptions; the PR title can carry extra context
- For the complete list of allowed scopes, refer to [Commit Message Rules](./commit.mdc)
