# ClickUp Task Management Rules

Define clear scope, actionable deliverables, and appropriate sizing for ClickUp tasks.

## Core Principles

- **Question everything**: Challenge unclear, oversized, or low-value work
- **Be concise**: Provide context and hints without fluff
- **Be ruthless with scope**: Push to break down >3 day efforts
- **Remove noise**: Delete template sections adding no value
- **Stay actively critical**: Never passively transcribe requests

## Task Metadata Standards

### Required Fields

- **Category**: Feature | Bug | Tech. Debt | Spike | Other
- **Scope**: Back | Front | Infra | Web3 | Other
- **Priority**: Low | Normal | High | Urgent
- **Effort (Fibonacci)**: 1 (≤1 day) | 2 (1-2 days) | 3 (2-3 days) | 5 (3-5 days)

### Default List

https://app.clickup.com/3005225/v/li/901321091597

Use unless user specifies different. This URL is environment- and workspace-specific—if it changes, confirm the correct default list with the team and update this rule.

## Automation Rules

- Always use ClickUp custom fields for metadata (not tags)
- Emojis allowed in titles; include in proposed title
- After creation, return task link and follow-up:
  1. Review description wording/scope
  2. Remove blank lines around headings
  3. Add sprint points (MCP may miss)
  4. Verify formatting (emojis, checklists, code)

## Task Template Structure

```markdown
#### TL;DR

[Single sentence with context not in title - max 25 words]
[OPTIONAL - remove if redundant]

---

### 📖 Context

[Why this exists, background, related work - 2-4 sentences max]
[OPTIONAL - remove if not adding value]

### ⚙️ Business Rules

- [ ] [Specific constraint or requirement]
- [ ] [Another rule]

### 🎯 Value Delivery

**Why:** [Strategic/business reason - 1 sentence]
**Value:** [Concrete benefit - 1 sentence]
**For whom:** [Specific stakeholder/user group]

### 💡 Implementation Suggestions

[Non-prescriptive hints, code snippets, gotchas]
[OPTIONAL - remove if nothing specific]

### 🔗 References

- [Link to Figma/Notion/Slack/docs]
  [OPTIONAL - remove if no relevant links]

### ✅ Definition of Done

- [ ] Implement and test [...]
- [ ] Verify [...]
```

## Definition of Done by Type

**Feature**: Implementation + tests + docs + integration verification
**Bug**: Fix + regression test + affected flow verification
**Tech. Debt**: Refactor + compatibility validation + performance check
**Spike**: Research output + recommendation + estimate

### DoD Format

Use specific, testable statements:

- ✅ `Implement and test MassID schema generation`
- ✅ `Add error handling for invalid UUID formats`
- ✅ `Verify JSON schema validates against example data`
- ❌ `Code works correctly` (too vague)
- ❌ `Testing complete` (not specific)

## Template Optimization

### Always Remove

- TL;DR restating title
- Context duplicating TL;DR
- Empty Implementation Suggestions
- Empty References
- Obvious Business Rules

### Always Keep

- Value Delivery (mandatory)
- Definition of Done (mandatory)

### Conditional Sections

Keep only when adding new information:

- **TL;DR**: Only if context beyond title
- **Context**: Only if explains "why now" or "what changed"
- **Business Rules**: Only non-obvious constraints
- **Implementation Suggestions**: Only with code snippets, gotchas, architecture notes
- **References**: Only with actual URLs

## Effort Estimation

**1 point (≤1 day)**: Script changes, config updates, minor bugs, docs

**2 points (1-2 days)**: Single schema type, isolated feature, straightforward integration

**3 points (2-3 days)**: Multiple schema interactions, cross-schema feature, moderate refactor

**5 points (3-5 days)**: **RED FLAG** - Must break down. Challenge: "What's the MVP?"

## Value Delivery Standards

Challenge weak statements:

❌ **Weak** → ✅ **Specific**

- "Improves platform" → "Reduces schema validation errors from 12% to <1%"
- "Better UX" → "Eliminates manual schema validation—auto-validates on generation"
- "Code quality" → "Reduces deployment gas by 23% through storage optimization"
- "Bug fix" → "Fixes validation issue where invalid timestamps were accepted (HIGH)"
- "Refactor" → "Consolidates 3 duplicate functions, reducing bundle by 15KB"

Ask when vague:

- "What specific metric improves?"
- "What was broken and now works?"
- "How will we measure success?"

## Critical Analysis Requirements

Challenge immediately when:

**Scope Red Flags:**

- Effort ≥5: "Split into: (1) [A] (3pts), (2) [B] (2pts). Which first?"
- Multiple concerns: "Combines [X], [Y], [Z]. Should we split?"
- Long exclusion list: "Too much scope. Can we narrow?"

**Clarity Red Flags:**

- Vague value: "Says 'improves security' but no risk. What vulnerability?"
- Unclear requirements: "Ambiguous. Clarify [specific aspect]?"
- Generic wording: "Uses generic terms. What specifically changes?"

**Priority Red Flags:**

- Urgent without blockers: "Marked urgent but no blockers. Can this wait?"
- High effort + urgent: "5 points AND urgent. What drives timeline?"
- Low value + high priority: "Priority High but value weak. What am I missing?"

## Critical Thinking Patterns

### Challenge Scope Creep

**Signals:**

- DoD has 8+ items
- Description includes "also" or "while we're here"
- Task requires Y but doesn't mention it

**Response:** "⚠️ Seems outside scope. Include [X], or separate task?"

### Push Back on Bad Decisions

**Signals:**

- Violates architecture patterns
- Breaks conventions
- Creates tight coupling
- Introduces tech debt

**Response:**

```markdown
⚠️ **CONCERN**: [specific issue]

**Problem:** This leads to [concrete problem]

**Alternative:** [better solution]

**Question:** Should we reconsider?
```

### Demand Clarity

**Signals:**

- Vague requirements
- Ambiguous business rules
- Missing edge cases
- Unclear integration points

**Response:**

```markdown
❓ **CLARIFICATION NEEDED**

**Context:** [what you're implementing]
**Ambiguity:** [unclear requirement]
**Interpretations:**

1. [Option A] - [implications]
2. [Option B] - [implications]

**Question:** Which interpretation correct?
**Impact:** [what breaks if wrong]
```

## Workflow: New Task

### Step 1: Gather Context

Ask before drafting:

1. What problem are we solving?
2. Which component/system affected?
3. Who benefits and how?
4. Expected effort (Fibonacci)? If >3 days, flag.

If missing or vague, pause and ask.

### Step 2: Assess Scope and Value

- Challenge effort ≥5: propose smaller increments
- Question urgency if value weak
- Flag mixed deliverables, suggest split
- Surface architectural risks
- Identify missing metadata

### Step 3: Draft Task

1. Propose metadata with justification
2. Craft emoji-friendly title (include emoji)
3. Populate template, remove non-value sections
4. Ensure DoD items testable, tied to scope
5. Include hints, snippets, warnings when helpful

### Step 4: Deliver Output

Return:

1. Outstanding questions or challenges (if any)
2. Recommended metadata summary
3. Proposed title
4. Task body in fenced markdown
5. ClickUp link (default or supplied)
6. Post-creation reminders

## Workflow: Task Refinement

### Step 1: Analyze Existing

Check for:

- Missing metadata
- Vague TL;DR ("improve", "enhance" without specifics)
- Missing/weak DoD
- Context-less business rules
- Generic value delivery

### Step 2: Ask Questions

Don't assume—ask:

- "Says 'improve X'—what metric defines success?"
- "Business Rule 2 vague—example of violation?"
- "Blocking something? Affects priority."

### Step 3: Rewrite Aggressively

- Strengthen weak language
- Add missing business rules
- Rewrite vague DoD as testable
- Remove fluff and redundancy

### Step 4: Challenge Scope Again

Even in refinement:

- "Seems like 2-3 tasks. Split?"
- "DoD has 8 items—5-pointer. Reduce scope?"

## Output Format Templates

### For New Tasks

```markdown
**Questions before creating:**

1. [Critical scope/value question]
2. [Clarification needed]

**Initial Assessment:**

- Estimated effort: [X points] - [reasoning]
- Suggested Category: [X] because [reason]
- ⚠️ [Red flags or suggestions]

**Proposed Task** (refine after answers):
[Template with current understanding]
```

### For Refinement

```markdown
**Issues Found:**

- [ ] [Specific problem]
- [ ] [Another issue]

**Questions/Suggestions:**

1. [Challenge or clarification]
2. [Improvement suggestion]

**Refined Task:**
[Complete template]

**Changes Made:**

- Removed: [...]
- Added: [...]
- Clarified: [...]
```

## Special Considerations

### TODO Comments

When user provides `// TODO:`:

1. Extract context from surrounding code
2. Identify component from path
3. Ask: "Immediate work or reminder?"
4. Suggest priority based on location

### Value Validation

Convert vague to concrete:

- From: "Improves developer experience"
- To: "Reduces deployment from 10min to 2min via automation"

## Examples of Active Criticism

**✅ Good:**

- "5-pointer has 3 deliverables. Split: (1) Schema implementation (3pts), (2) Generation script (2pts), (3) Docs (1pt). Which first?"
- "Value says 'improves security' but no risk. What vulnerability?"
- "Marked urgent but no blockers. Wait until next sprint?"

**❌ Passive (Avoid):**

- "Looks good!"
- "Template completed."
- "Let me know if changes needed."

## Integration

Align with:

- `@commit.mdc` - Commit conventions (scopes, types)
- `@branch-naming.mdc` - Branch naming (types, scopes, IDs)
- `@pull-request.mdc` - PR standards
- `/task-exec` - Task execution workflow

Ensure consistency across commits, branches, and task metadata.
