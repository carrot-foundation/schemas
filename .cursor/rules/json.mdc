# Cursor Rules for JSON Files

## Formatting Standards

- Use 2-space indentation consistently
- No trailing commas in JSON files
- Use double quotes for all strings
- Maintain consistent line breaks between top-level properties
- Keep arrays and objects properly formatted with appropriate spacing

## Property Naming Conventions

- Use snake_case for property names (following project convention)
- Use descriptive, meaningful property names
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're well-established (e.g., "id", "url")
- Use consistent naming patterns across related schemas

## Structure Organization

- Order properties logically:
  1. Schema metadata (`$schema`, `$id`, etc.)
  2. Core identification fields
  3. Required business logic fields
  4. Optional/extended fields
  5. Nested objects and arrays
- Keep nesting levels reasonable (max 4-5 levels deep)
- Group related properties together

## Value Formatting

- Use proper data types (string, number, boolean, array, object)
- Format dates as ISO 8601 strings
- Use string format for large integers (token IDs, etc.)
- Provide meaningful default values where appropriate
- Use null explicitly rather than omitting optional fields when clarity is needed
