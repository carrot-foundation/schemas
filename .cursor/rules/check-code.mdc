# Check Code

## Overview

Run automated project checks and fix all issues. Do not ignore warnings/errors without explicit approval.

## Rules

- Fix all lint, type, spelling, and test issues

- If you must add an ignore comment (eslint-disable, @ts-ignore, etc.), **stop and ask for approval first**

- Every ignore comment must include a clear explanation of why it's necessary

- Re-run checks after fixes to verify success

## Commands

```bash
# Sequential execution (recommended for CI/safety)
pnpm check

# Parallel execution (faster, runs all checks in parallel)
pnpm check:parallel
```

The `check` script runs: `lint:fix` → `format` → `type-check` → `spell-check` → `pkgJsonLint` → `build` → `validate-schemas` → `verify-schema-versions` → `check-refs` → `test`

## Process

1. Run all checks

2. Analyze failures and fix the root cause

3. If a legitimate ignore is needed, ask: "Should I ignore [specific issue] because [reason]?"

4. Re-run checks until all pass

5. Report summary of changes made
